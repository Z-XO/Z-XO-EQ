# Z-XO-EQ

Simple EQ VST3 plugin created using the JUCE framework. The code for the plugin contains a 3-Band Equalizer with a Spectrum Analyzer that uses the Fast Fourier Transform to
display the frequencies . 


This code should compile and run on any version of Visual Studio while using JUCE. As of right now, it is fully functioning. As time permits, I do plan on returning intermittingly 
to not only update but refine various features.
Some of which include:
- Better GUI
- Performance increase (as FFT is very taxing)
- Possible ON/OFF button for the analyzer
- Labels for the Low/High/Parametric Bands

Special thank you to MatKatMusic and his tutorials on youtube. I will link his youtube channel below. Would not have been able to do this without his guidance.
